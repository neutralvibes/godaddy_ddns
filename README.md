# GODADDY DDNS UPDATER

## Introduction

Mapping your private networks public facing ip address to a domain name is a requirement many people have. If you have purchased a domain name from GoDaddy, this will easily allow you to keep a sub domain name pointing to that ip address without any additional cost. The only requirement otherwise is having a linux machine to schedule the updating from.

## Getting started

1. Login to your GoDaddy account and go to https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted.

2. Create your API Key and Secret for testing and live

3. Update the sections in the config file for you keys, secrets, main domain name and sub domain to be used.
